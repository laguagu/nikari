## CARE INSTRUCTIONS

Solid Wood Furniture Benefits:
Furniture made of solid wood offers aesthetic and performance benefits, requiring proper care. Cold and dry winter climates, along with indoor heating, create a very dry environment harmful to both humans and wooden furniture. Likewise, very humid months can adversely affect furniture without proper care.

Seasonal Wood Behavior:
- Dry Climates: Wood may shrink, causing natural cracks. These usually resolve when the humidity increases, causing the wood to swell.
- Humid Climates: Wood might swell and disrupt moving parts like drawers, typically returning to normal as it dries.

Maintenance Advice:
- Surface Care: Use natural wood oil mixtures for surface finishes. Always clean any spills within 15 minutes with a damp cloth and organic soaps.
- Biennial Care: Clean the tabletop with fine sandy cloth every two years, then treat with natural matte wood oil or wax. Allow the oil-wax to impregnate for 15-20 minutes before wiping off excess and polishing with a clean cloth.
- Finish Maintenance: Follow specific product instructions for the surface finish oil mixture. Avoid silicone-based or non-natural oils and waxes.

Special Cases:
- Stained or Lacquered Wood: Lacquer protects the wood effectively from liquids and dirt. Clean spills quickly with a damp cloth and organic soap. If the lacquer is damaged, it should be sanded and re-applied. Contact [sales@nikari.fi](mailto:sales@nikari.fi) for more instructions.

EXTRA - Laminate Surface Maintenance:
Laminate surfaces should be cleaned regularly with a damp cloth and mild detergent or household cleaners. For tough stains, use non-abrasive cleaners or solvents. After using solvents, rinse the surface thoroughly with warm water to remove any detergent residue.

The chair's silhouette is thoroughly clear and reduced, and the harmonious proportions are complemented by delicate wooden joints. The chair is available in birch, oak or ash, and it can be equipped with a linking device.

The Seminar chair was originally developed as a model piece for a seminar when Nikari's founder, master cabinetmaker Kari Virtanen gave a lecture for design students on traditional wooden chairs and wanted to concretise his ideas. Besides seminar halls, all items of the Seminar collection are ideal for a wide variety of public spaces.

## COLLECTION: SEMINAR

The durable Seminar series was developed little by little throughout the decades, starting with the light KVT1 chair and adding necessary pieces, such as a stackable chair, a bench, tables and upholstered sofas. The different features of the collection pieces make it a good choice for public premises.

The chair's silhouette is thoroughly clear and reduced, and the harmonious proportions are complemented by delicate wooden joints. The chair can be equipped with a linking device, seat upholstery, acoustic plate underneath the seat and even a hymn book holder. Available in birch, oak and ash.

Kari Virtanen, Nikari's founder, master cabinet maker and Kaj Franck Design Award 2022 winner, wanted to celebrate his special connection to Kaj Franck, Finland's “father of modern design,” who used to work quite closely with Kari during the 1970's. The 2022 award was, therefore, very meaningful for Kari and inspired a new creation, the STORIA chair, which follows the local craftsmanship tradition of the spoke-back chair, but with modern elements and dimensions.
This softly curved, yet very straight-forward chair, is available in sustainably grown oiled ash or oak.

## COLLECTION: STORIA

When Nikari turned 50 years in 2017, the company celebrated the birthday with a theme ”50 years of stories”. The Storia collection began to develop throughout the 50th anniversary year, bringing interesting addition to the company collection. It has been growing ever since, finding fresh forms by using traditional Nordic craftsmanship techniques.
